BEAN SALAD

A great salad for summer or winter—this salad always seems to disappear from our lunches at church, so I think it's time to write it down for the entire world!

2 cups cooked, drained navy beans

2 cups cooked, drained cranberry beans

2 cups cooked, drained great northern beans

2 cups cooked, drained kidney beans

1 cup cooked, drained borlotti beans

1 cup cooked, drained pink beans

2 red bell peppers, thinly sliced

2 onions, thinly sliced

1½ cups black olives, sliced

1 red pepper, thinly sliced

¼ cup vegetable oil

½ cup extra-virgin olive oil

1 tablespoon Dijon mustard

1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar

4 cloves garlic, chopped

Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste

Freshly ground pepper

4 to 6 Romaine lettuce leaves

2 scallions, thinly sliced

2 large tomatoes, cut into wedges

1 cucumber, cut into cubes

Combine the beans in a large bowl and set aside.

In a large bowl, combine the bell peppers, onions, black olives, and red pepper. In a medium bowl, whisk together the vegetable oil, olive oil, mustard, balsamic vinegar, garlic, kosher salt, freshly ground pepper, and a few grinds of pepper. Pour this dressing over the bell pepper mixture and toss to coat well.

Add the bell pepper mixture to the beans, and stir to combine. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving.

Spoon onto plates and place a Romaine lettuce leaf on top of each serving. Scatter with scallions, tomatoes, and cucumber. Serve immediately.

Makes 10 to 12 servings.

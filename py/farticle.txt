<p>BEAN SALAD</p>
<p>A great salad for summer or winter—this salad always seems to disappear from our lunches at church, so I think it's time to write it down for the entire world!</p>
<p>2 cups cooked, drained navy beans</p>
<p>2 cups cooked, drained cranberry beans</p>
<p>2 cups cooked, drained great northern beans</p>
<p>2 cups cooked, drained kidney beans</p>
<p>1 cup cooked, drained borlotti beans</p>
<p>1 cup cooked, drained pink beans</p>
<p>2 red bell peppers, thinly sliced</p>
<p>2 onions, thinly sliced</p>
<p>1½ cups black olives, sliced</p>
<p>1 red pepper, thinly sliced</p>
<p>¼ cup vegetable oil</p>
<p>½ cup extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</p>
<p>1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar</p>
<p>4 cloves garlic, chopped</p>
<p>Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</p>
<p>Freshly ground pepper</p>
<p>4 to 6 Romaine lettuce leaves</p>
<p>2 scallions, thinly sliced</p>
<p>2 large tomatoes, cut into wedges</p>
<p>1 cucumber, cut into cubes</p>
<p>Combine the beans in a large bowl and set aside.</p>
<p>In a large bowl, combine the bell peppers, onions, black olives, and red pepper. In a medium bowl, whisk together the vegetable oil, olive oil, mustard, balsamic vinegar, garlic, kosher salt, freshly ground pepper, and a few grinds of pepper. Pour this dressing over the bell pepper mixture and toss to coat well.</p>
<p>Add the bell pepper mixture to the beans, and stir to combine. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving.</p>
<p>Spoon onto plates and place a Romaine lettuce leaf on top of each serving. Scatter with scallions, tomatoes, and cucumber. Serve immediately.</p>
<p>Makes 10 to 12 servings.</p>
